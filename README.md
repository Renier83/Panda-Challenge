# Panda-Challenge
Its time to put all i have learn in python to the test. Given a set of data i had to create a story using the information to answer specific questions! The fun part is that thjis data was about people who attended a bootcamp. Getting to tell a story just with data had to be the most fun i have had during the entire class.
